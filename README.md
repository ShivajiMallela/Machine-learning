# Machine-learning

Welcome to my machine learning journey repository! Here, I document my progress and learnings as I dive into the fascinating world of machine learning.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find various code files and Jupyter Notebooks that reflect my learning process. Each file corresponds to a different aspect of machine learning, covering topics such as data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and experimentation.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks where I explore different machine learning concepts and algorithms.

## Contents

- **1. Exploring Data Preprocessing**: This notebook covers the essentials of data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- **2. Model Selection and Evaluation**: Here, I delve into the process of selecting the right machine learning model for a given problem and evaluating its performance using various metrics.

- **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**: In this notebook, I explore the concept of hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of machine learning models.

- **4. Building Pipelines**: Learn how to streamline the machine learning workflow using Scikit-Learn's Pipeline class.

- **5. Experimentation and Iteration**: Discover the importance of experimentation in machine learning and how to iteratively improve model performance.

- **6. Conclusion and Next Steps**: A concluding notebook where I summarize my learning journey and suggest resources for further exploration.
